Error-Console
=============

A multipurpose console for displaying logs or errors. 

Normal logs are shown in black text.
Error logs are shown in red text.

It has the capability to save your logs to a text file if you wish to do so.

It was designed with it being an add on to a main application in mind.


Instructions for use:

1. Create an instance of the Console class. Eg. Console console = new Console();
2. Use console.log(String message) or console.logError(String message) to log messages.


As always with my programs, this is open source and free to use by everyone. Please give credit where due, though.
