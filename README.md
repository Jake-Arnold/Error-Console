Error-Console
=============

A multipurpose console for displaying logs or errors. 

Normal logs are shown in black text.
Error logs are shown in red text.

It has the capability to save your logs to a text file if you wish to do so.

It was designed with it being an add on to a main application in mind.


Instructions for use:

1. Create an instance of the Console class. Eg. Console console = new Console();
2. Use console.log(String message) or console.logError(String message) to log messages.
3. See the Documentation at http://rakeyjakey.com/java/console/docs in order to view the official documentation.

As always with my programs, this is open source and free to use by everyone.
